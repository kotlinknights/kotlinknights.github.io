title: Welcome to Kotlin Knights!
---

Welcome to Kotlin Knights. We are a Bristol based study group aiming to learn more about the Kotlin programming language. We meet up usually once a month and try to coincide the meetings with a [SWmobile meetup](https://www.meetup.com/swmobile/). Most of us use Kotlin for Android development but are interested in Kotlin's application in other areas too.

# At the meet ups

We aim to do meet at a friendly venue after work. Usually a cafe or a pub with wifi. Times are usually around 17:00 - 19:00 and we try to split the time 50:50 into coding / learning on own or pair programming and then a round table to mention one thing you have learned about Kotlin recently.


# Ideas for what to do

Everyone needs somewhere to start! If you are stuck how about:

* Convert an existing open source project to Kotlin.
* Submit PRs into the Kotlin Knights Slack channel for others to comment on.
* Repo owners ask for help converting their own apps to Kotlin.
